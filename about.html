				<p class="intro">I am a PhD student working in computer-aided prognosis with medical images.</p>
				<p class="intro"> In this website you will find my CV and publications but most importantly, <a href="tutorial.html">tutorials</a> about different aspects of my work such as image processing, deep learning, and survival analysis. </p>

					<h1>Schooling</h1>
<p>  I gratuated from <a href="https://sante.u-pec.fr/formations/isbs">ISBS Paris (Health and Biomedical engineering)</a> (now EPISEN), in 2018 with bioinformatics/imaging and biomechanics/biomaterial specialities. In addition to the medical biology courses, this engineering school provides skills in all areas related to health, such as computer science, marketing, economics, regulation and quality, mechanics etc.
Half of the week was spent at the Faculty of Medicine in Créteil (UPEC) for courses in medical biology, mechanics, biomaterials and regulations mainly. The other half took place at ESIEE Marne-la-Vallée for courses in computer science, algorithms, marketing, management etc.
This school therefore enabled me to acquire knowledge in all areas related to health. This multidisciplinarity allows a good adaptation when entering the job market and to be able to interact with the different teams of a company. It also gives a global vision of the development of medical products. However, although specialised in biomedical, the skills acquired can also be used in any other field.

<h1> Current personal projects</h1>
<h3> Application to learn a new language, Android Studio </h3>
<p> I am currently working on an Android application to help to learn a language. It is a dictionary of learned words that we can add by ourself. It contains tests on these words. We can classify the words by theme, importance, degree of learning etc. and choose only some of them for the test.
I began this application, first to learn Java but also because, when I was learning a language (Swedish) I found a lot of application that test you to learn words but non of them kept track of all learned words and grammar rules. So I decided to create my own Android application.<br>
<u>Acquired knowledge</u>:  Android studio, Java, HTML, CSS, XML, SQLite </p>

<h3>Personal website with tutorials </h3>
<p>This website is part of one of my projetcs. I created this personal website to learn HTML and CSS. I also began a tutorial containing all I learned during my PhD to keep track of them and also to share with people which want to learn more about survival analysis, image processing and machine learning.
	Thus I decided to add this tutoriel that was first in pdf format to the website. However this part is still in progress but will be finish during the year. <br>
<u>Acquired knowledge</u>:  HTML, CSS, XML </p>

<h3>Alumni EPISEN, ISBS – IT manager </h3>
<p>I am member of the Alumi (former students assocation) since september 2020. The purpose of this assocation is to help current students to find interships and understand possibilities they have after the diploma, and help current and
former students to find a PhD or a job. I am the IT manager and created the new website.
This new  <a href="https://bdaisbs.wixsite.com/alumni-episen">website</a> contains new functionalities such as the member account for example.
We also organised a forum in 2021 to present different post-ISBS pathways and help members to create a network. <br/>
<u>Acquired knowledge</u>:   website creation, event organisation<p>

<h3>ACCORD association, Clos Toreau Nantes - School support </h3>
	<p>Since September 2020, I have been volunteering in a underprivilaged neighbourhood organisation to help school children in academic difficulty. I mainly deal with sciences (mathematics, physics, chemistry, life sciences). <br/>
	<u>Acquired knowledge</u>:   Pedagogy<p>
<!-- <h3>COVID data extractor – Poitiers hospital </h3>
Collaboration with Poitier hospital to help them in Covid-19 data extraction on gouvernemental website to predict hospital saturation. Extraction with python on different website of statistical numbers by department and age: positive covid tests, reanimation occupation, other diseases data (Flu, diabetes, obesity, bronchitis etc.)
<u>Acquired knowledge</u>:  selenium package, python -->
